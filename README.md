# E-Commerce Sales Analysis Project - README

## Project Overview
This project focuses on performing a comprehensive analysis of an e-commerce store's sales and profit data using Python, specifically leveraging **Pandas** for data manipulation and **Plotly** for interactive visualizations. The goal is to uncover insights into sales and profit trends across various dimensions such as months, categories, sub-categories, and customer segments.

## Objectives
1. **Monthly Sales Analysis**:
   - Calculate the total sales for each month.
   - Identify the month with the highest and lowest sales.

2. **Category Sales Analysis**:
   - Analyze sales by product category to determine which category has the highest and lowest sales.

3. **Sub-Category Sales Analysis**:
   - Perform a detailed sales analysis at the sub-category level to identify top and bottom performers.

4. **Monthly Profit Analysis**:
   - Calculate monthly profits and identify the most and least profitable months.

5. **Category and Sub-Category Profit Analysis**:
   - Analyze profits by category and sub-category to determine profitability trends.

6. **Customer Segment Analysis**:
   - Analyze sales and profit by customer segments to uncover key customer behavior patterns.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python**: Programming language used for analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data cleaning, manipulation, and aggregation.
- **Plotly**: For creating interactive and visually appealing charts and graphs.

## Data Requirements
The dataset should contain the following columns (or similar):
- `Order Date`: Date when the sale was made.
- `Sales`: The sales amount.
- `Profit`: The profit generated.
- `Category`: The main category of the product.
- `Sub-Category`: The sub-category of the product.
- `Customer Segment`: The segment of the customer (e.g., Consumer, Corporate, Home Office).

Ensure the dataset is cleaned and formatted appropriately before analysis:
- Date columns should be converted to datetime format.
- Numeric columns like `Sales` and `Profit` should not contain missing or invalid values.

## Steps to Reproduce the Analysis
1. **Setup**:
   - Install required libraries using pip: `pip install pandas plotly`.
   - Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**:
   - Convert the `Order Date` column to datetime.
   - Extract the month and year from `Order Date` for grouping.
   - Handle missing or duplicate values if present.

3. **Analysis**:
   - Use Pandas groupby and aggregation functions for monthly, category, and segment-level analysis.
   - Calculate total sales and profits for each grouping.
   - Identify trends and outliers.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Use Plotly to create interactive charts such as:
     - Line charts for monthly sales and profits.
     - Bar charts for category and sub-category comparisons.
     - Pie charts for customer segment contributions.

5. **Documentation**:
   - Summarize findings with clear visuals.
   - Highlight actionable insights and recommendations.


## Expected Outcomes
- Insights into the storeâ€™s best and worst-performing months, categories, and sub-categories.
- Identification of high-value customer segments.
- Interactive visualizations to support decision-making.

## Conclusion
This project provides a structured approach to e-commerce sales analysis using Python. By following the outlined steps and leveraging Pandas and Plotly, you can uncover valuable insights to drive business decisions effectively.
